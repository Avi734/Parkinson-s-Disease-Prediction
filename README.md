# Parkinson's Disease Prediction Using Explainable AI

This project leverages machine learning models and Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to predict Parkinson's disease diagnosis. The entire model pipeline, including various ML algorithms and the LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) model, is implemented to enhance transparency and interpretability.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict Parkinson's disease using a variety of machine learning models while incorporating XAI methods to improve understanding and trust in the modelâ€™s predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Predictive Models**: A variety of machine learning algorithms are used for prediction.
- **Explainability**: Incorporation of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME models to explain the predictions.
- **Model Interpretability**: The focus is on building explainable models that provide insight into the decision-making process.
